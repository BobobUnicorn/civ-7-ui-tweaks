# BobobUnicorn's UI Tweaks

This is essentially a small collection of minor UI issues that have affected me during normal gameplay and will be updated occasionally.

Version compatibility: 1.0.3

## Currently Implemented

- adds a visible countdown/counter for Celebrations
- adds an icon on the diplomacy ribbon when a civ is neutral toward you
